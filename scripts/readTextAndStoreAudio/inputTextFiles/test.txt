In the quiet hours just before dawn, the world seems to hold its breath. Streets lie empty, shadows stretch long, and a gentle hum of silence blankets everything in sight. Somewhere, a lone cat slips through an alley, its steps light as whispers. The air feels thicker, as if heavy with unspoken secrets, and the trees stand still, their leaves unmoving in a windless peace. Every so often, a distant sound—a car horn, a bird's tentative call—breaks the stillness, only to be swallowed again by the predawn calm. It's a time of pause, where the city and its inhabitants rest in a collective hush before the day roars back to life.
