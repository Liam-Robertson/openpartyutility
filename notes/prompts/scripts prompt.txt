---------

This is my scripts codebase

It has both kotlin scrips in it and python scripts in it. I'm only going to ask you to write python scripts so ignore kotlin 

For any answer you give me, use the cleanest architecture possible.

Whenever you give me code, give me the entire file, don't abbreviate

don't leave comments in the code
-----

Write me a new python script using the chatgpt api 

I want to summarise a text file. Use this package structure and put it under the python folder 

    └── summariseTextTranscription/
        ├── summariseTextTranscription.py
        └── resources/
            ├── inputTextTranscriptions/
            └── outputTextSummary/

The purpose of this script is to take in a text file from inputTextTranscriptions, summarise it using a prompt, then output the summary into outputTextSummary

I want the summary to be about half as long as the input text 

For example, the first task I'm going to give you is to take a 40,000 word text file and summarise it to 20,000 words (i.e. teh output is about half as long as the input) 

Also I'm aware that large files like 40,000 words might break the open ai toke limits. If that's true, then try to chunk the files in a sensible way. However try and chunk them as little as is possible
